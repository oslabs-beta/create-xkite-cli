Creates the xkite Command Line Interface (CLI) Utility.

Command Line Interface for xkite, a Kafka Integrated Testing Environment. Another tool in the xkite library to give the user flexibility and control over their Kafka ecosystem.

- Easy to use Command Line Interface (CLI) to interact with the xkite-core library. Itâ€™s a simple alternative to the full xkite GUI, meant to provide users with the ability to automate their testing using scripts.
- Configure a custom docker ecosystem using command line inputs or a <code>config.json</code> file, deploy, pause/ unpause, shutdown, and remove containers and volumes.
- Download the docker ecosystem configuration (package.zip) containing the docker-compose.yml file and dependencies in order to deploy their ecosystem on a cloud instance/remote server by simply running docker-compose up.
- Acts as a remote client to interface with the xkite GUI server. The user can perform all the aforementioned functions provided remotely on the xkite GUI server by providing the URL as a configuration input.
- More granular control over which docker images they choose to deploy (something that is not configurable currently with the xkite GUI).
